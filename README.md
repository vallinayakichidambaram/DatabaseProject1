# DatabaseProject1
SQL Development Project

Hi! Welcome to the first Database Project!
The aim of this project is to create a relational database for an eCommerce Platform

Our eCommerce website is so simple - just like any website like Amazon, Flipkart

Here is a brief overview of our project. This will be helpful in better understanding of ER model!

There is a parent grouping called Main Category 
Ex - Fashion, Entertainment, etc

Under Main Category, there are numerous sub categories
Ex. Under Fashion, we have Clothing for Men, Clothing for Women, Men Accessories, Women Accessories, etc

Products will be tagged under Sub Category

There is a search page which shows the list of products
And Customer Profile which displays the customer details like Name, email, contact number, addresses saved, saved payment methods and more

And there is the orders page
which shows the list of orders for a particular customer

A Product is supplied by a number of Suppliers - Suppliers for a product will be decided for a customer based on the pincode
Suppliers nearer to the customers will be considered as primary option.

A Supplier can deliver multiple products.
